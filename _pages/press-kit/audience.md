Presenting on the subjects of their choice, Ignite speakers have only a few minutes to amuse, educate, enlighten, or inspire the audience. Talks cover a wide range of topics, from roller skating to nuclear reactors.

Ignite is all about fast and fun presentations. Speakers must build their presentations with 20 slides, each of which is shown for 15 seconds, giving each speaker 5 minutes of fame.

In addition to the quick-fire talks, these events are a great place to catch up with old friends and make new ones over a drink and snacks. Whether you're most interested in being inspired or meeting new folks, Ignite is the perfect place to have fun and feel "ignited" about life all over again.

Our events have a history of selling out so [get your tickets](/tickets) quickly.
